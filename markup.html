	<p><center> 
	The <strong>past is the past</strong> for a reason.<br>
	That is where it is supposed to stay,<br>
	But some cannot <strong>let it go.</strong><br>
	In their heads it eats away 
	<br>
	<br>
	Until all their focus becomes<br>
	The person they used to be,<br>
	The <em>mistakes</em> they made in their life.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That you cannot change what happened,<br>
	<strong>No matter how hard you try,</strong><br>
	<strong>No matter how much you think about it,</strong><br>
	<strong>No matter how much you cry.</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	What happens in your <em>lifetime</em><br>
	<em>Happens for reasons unknown</em>,<br>
	Let your story be shown. 
	<br>	
	<br>
	Don't get wrapped up in the<em>negative.</em> <br>
	Be happy with what you have been given.<br>
	Live for <em>today not tomorrow.</em><br>
	<strong>Get up, get out, and start living,</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	Because the past is the past for a reason.<br>
	It's been, and now it is gone,<br>
	So stop trying to think of ways to fix it.<br>
	It's done, it's unchangeable; <em><strong>move on!</em></strong>
