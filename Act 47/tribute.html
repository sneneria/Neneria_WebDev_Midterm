		<h1> BTS ARMY </h1> 
		<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
		<br>is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[3] The septet—composed 
		<br>of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-write and co-produce much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has 
		<br>evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, 
		<br>the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an 
		<br>alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.
