	<p><center> 
		The past is the past for a reason.<br>
	That is where it is supposed to stay,<br>
	But some cannot let it go.<br>
	In their heads it eats away 
	<br>
	<br>
	Until all their focus becomes<br>
	The person they used to be,<br>
	The mistakes they made in their life.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That you cannot change what happened,<br>
	No matter how hard you try,<br>
	No matter how much you think about it,<br>
	No matter how much you cry. 
	<br>
	<br>
	What happens in your lifetime<br>
	Happens for reasons unknown,<br>
	Let your story be shown. 
	<br>	
	<br>
	Don't get wrapped up in the negative. <br>
	Be happy with what you have been given.<br>
	Live for today not tomorrow.<br>
	Get up, get out, and start living, 
	<br>
	<br>
	Because the past is the past for a reason.<br>
	It's been, and now it is gone,<br>
	So stop trying to think of ways to fix it.<br>
	It's done, it's unchangeable; move on.
